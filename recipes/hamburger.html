    <h2>A fresh burger hot off the grill</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds ground chuck (80/20)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp onion powder</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>6 buns, toasted, if desired</li>
      <li>6 slices cheddar cheese, or your favorite cheese</li>
      <li>6 lettuce leaves</li>
      <li>1 beefsteak tomato, sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 of a red or white onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>6 pickles slices</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make burger seasoning by combining all spices in a bowl.
        Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide ground chuck into 6 equal portions and gently
        from into Â½ inch thick patties that are wider than the
        burger buns (as they will shrink). Use your thumb to
        press an indentation into the center of each patty.
        Cover and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat grill to medium high heat. Just before
        cooking, sprinkle seasoning over the patties,
        then place on hot grill, indent-side up. Close
        grill lid and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the
        bottom of the burger is seared and juices are
        accumulating on top of the burger. Flip and cook
        an additional 3-4 minutes or until the beef reaches
        160 degrees F.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place cheese on burgers during the last minute of
        cooking. Remove to a plate and allow to rest for a
        few minutes before serving in a bun, with toppings.
      </li>
